# The project

> In July 2017, a group of programmers, designers, students and people from all professions gathered together having a 3-day hackathon in Philadelphia. It was the third time g0v, a renowned civil-tech online community in Taiwan, had their hackathon in the east coast U.S., and it's where **Taiwan Watch** project was born.
